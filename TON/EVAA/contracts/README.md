# Audit of v8 by Trail of Bits

The EVAA v8 contracts have been audited by Trail of Bits. You can read the full audit report here: [certificate](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-08-evaafinance-securityreview.pdf).

*The version of the contract code in this repo matches the GitHub commit `ef9ea250b674e1d96c52ce12c4552778e10322b9` from the original repository.*

*To verify that the code in the `./contracts` folder is the same as the audited version, compare the hashes of each file in this folder with the hashes listed in the Trail of Bits certificate.*

*If you'd like to compare the hash of a specific file with the one in the audit report, check out commit `393b4c386c80a7333eb26def323afc5e3c43b9d5` in this repo. Then, generate the hash for the file and compare it with the one in the audit certificate.*

# Audit of v6 by Quantstamp

The EVAA v6 contracts have been audited by Quantstamp. You can read the full audit report here: [certificate](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/evaa/df7aa699-793b-49f7-b348-1f78e9ca9870/index.html).

*The version of the v6 contract code matches the GitHub commit `55096cf1fd091629ff8dad783f71fb4758eded46` from the original repository.*

*To verify that the code in the `./contracts` folder is the same as the audited version, compare the hashes of each file in this folder with the hashes listed in the Quantstamp certificate.*

*If you'd like to compare the hash of a specific file with the one in the audit report, check out commit `1fb4e31dd7874391e34bae2cdfa5dd0d48b5d181` in this repo. Then, generate the hash for the file and compare it with the one in the audit certificate.*

# Technical Smart Contract README

Diagrams schemas for logic of EVAA protocol contracts can be found in the `./diagrams` folder.

TLB schemas for transaction bodies and storage can be found in the `./schema` folder.

# Folder Structure in `./contracts`

- `/` - Root code files, each compiling to a separate smart contract.
- `/core` - Main code of the protocol (rcv opcode → parse incoming tx → execute some logic (call functions from `/logic` folder) → send outgoing tx).
- `/logic` - Main logic functions of the protocol.
- `/data` - Functions to work with data: packers, unpackers, `.store_X`, `~load_X`, etc. – everything intermediate that is not used as a "final" type (storage or message).
- `/storage` - Functions for packing/unpacking & saving/reading storage of user & master smart contracts.
- `/messages` - "Final" types representing messages and functions to work with them.
- `/constants` - Files with constants (opcodes, errors, fees), many of them.
- `/external` - Everything not directly related to EVAA.

# Main Data Types

## Master Smart Contract

### `asset_config_collection`
Dictionary: `asset_id` → `asset_config`
Configuration of a particular asset, which is set during its initialization and cannot be changed (the admin can only change it if absolutely necessary).

### `asset_dynamics_collection`
Dictionary: `asset_id` → `asset_dynamics`
Information about current changing data (such as `sRate`, `bRate`, etc.) related to a specific asset.

## User Smart Contract

### `user_principals`
Dictionary: `asset` → `balance` (positive for deposits and negative for debts).

### `user_rewards`
Dictionary: `asset` → `tracking_indexes` & `tracking_accrued` (information about how much a user will receive for positions in a particular token).

## Various

`asset_id` ≈ `sha256` from the ticker of the token (e.g., 'TON', 'jUSDT', 'jUSDC').
